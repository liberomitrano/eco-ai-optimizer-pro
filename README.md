Eco-AI Optimizer v2.0 pro
"Small code, big change for the planet.".
This version of the engine focuses on the core principles of sustainable computing, optimizing AI models to run with minimal resources without losing intelligence.
💡 The Problem
AI models require massive energy power, which is critical for Earth's resources and constrained environments like space. This creates a high carbon footprint and excessive heat.
🚀 The Solution: Dynamic Quantization
4x Lighter Models: Reduces model size by up to 75% through INT8 quantization.
Lower Energy Consumption: Direct reduction in battery and electricity usage.
Thermal Efficiency: Optimized processing generates significantly less hardware heat.
🛠️ v2.0 Technical Status
Environmental Impact: Verified as "GREAT IMPACT" for sustainable AI.
Target Layers: Optimized for Linear and Recurrent neural networks.
Developer: Libero Mitrano (13 years old).
